# Overview #
ChromeVox is a Chrome extension for Chrome 14 or higher and runs on Mac, Windows, and Linux. If you have any trouble installing ChromeVox, please try asking for help on the [axs-chrome-discuss mailing list](http://groups.google.com/group/axs-chrome-discuss). Make sure to say what version of Chrome and which operating system you are using.

After you install ChromeVox, any time the extension is active ChromeVox will speak to you. However, you will have to refresh pages that were already open before you activated ChromeVox.

# Dependencies #
You need to [install Chrome](http://www.google.com/chrome) in order to use ChromeVox. ChromeVox works on Chrome 14 or higher - we recommend using the Chrome Beta Channel.

On Windows and Mac platforms, the ChromeVox TTS (text-to-speech) will work without any extra steps on your part. On Linux, you will have to set up the TTS yourself.

# Installing ChromeVox #
You can install ChromeVox from the Chrome Web Store. Choose the installation instructions for your platform. Instructions for Linux will be posted soon.

  * [Instructions for Windows](http://google-axs-chrome.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/chromevox_tutorial/setup_chromevox_windows.html)

**Please note:** For security reasons, ChromeVox will not talk when you're browsing the Chrome Web Store. All Chrome extensions follow this rule.
