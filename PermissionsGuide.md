When you install ChromeVox, a dialog pops up titled "Confirm Installation" that lists the permissions that ChromeVox needs in order to run in your browser. Just like when you install any other screen reader, ChromeVox requests these permissions from you so that it can effectively speak the content on every page that you visit.

ChromeVox requests access to:
  * Your data on all websites
  * Your bookmarks
  * Your tabs and browsing activity

ChromeVox needs access to "Your data on all websites" in order to speak all the content on every website that you visit.

ChromeVox needs access to your bookmarks in order to speak them to you.

ChromeVox needs access to "Your tabs and browsing activity" so that ChromeVox can announce when you've opened or closed new tabs and windows.

ChromeVox is an [open-source project](http://code.google.com/p/google-axs-chrome/source/browse), so you can inspect the ChromeVox code if you'd like to see why these permissions are necessary. For more information on all of the permissions that can be requested by Chrome apps and extensions, please see the [Web Store Help page on Permissions](http://www.google.com/support/chrome/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=186213). You can also see the [Chrome Extensions Developer Guide](http://code.google.com/chrome/extensions/permission_warnings.html) for specific information on how Chrome extensions may use the permissions that they request.
