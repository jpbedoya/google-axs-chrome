# ChromeVox Quick Start #
The browser beeps when a page has finished loading and is ready for you to navigate.

  * The ChromeVox modifier keys are `Control+Alt` on Windows, Mac, and Linux. On Chrome OS devices, the modifier keys are `Shift+Search`. You use the modifier keys in conjunction with other keys to control ChromeVox.
  * To navigate forwards and backwards through a page, use the ChromeVox modifier keys with the `down` and `up` arrow keys.
  * To change the amount of content ChromeVox will speak at a time, use the ChromeVox modifier keys with the `left` and `right` arrow keys.
  * At any time, you can press the `Control` key to stop the current speech.

# The ChromeVox Lens #
You can use the ChromeVox lens to display what the TTS is speaking. This is useful if you don't want to listen to speech or don't have a TTS engine set up on your platform. To toggle the lens:
  * Windows/Mac/Linux: `Control+Alt+L+L`
  * Windows/Mac/Linux: `Shift+Search+L+L`

# User Guide #
We've written a [user guide](http://google-axs-chrome.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/chromevox_tutorial/index.html) that contains a few resources to help you getting started with ChromeVox.

Please note that the documentation is aimed at end users using ChromeVox on Chrome OS devices. That's why the guide refers to "starting ChromeVox with Control+Alt+Z at the sign-in screen" and we refer to the `Search` key.

**Also, on platforms other than Chrome OS the ChromeVox modifier keys are `Control+Alt`.  So if you're running ChromeVox on Windows, Mac, or Linux, in the documentation whenever you see `Shift+Search` use `Control+Alt` instead**

Please bear with us!  The user guide is still a work in progress. It covers the basics of using ChromeVox, but we're still writing pages on more sophisticated topics like page-specific commands. For right now, the table navigation page is the last page.
